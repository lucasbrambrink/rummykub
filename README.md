# rummykub
A quasi-polynomial algorithm for solving rummykub states. It is mostly exponential, but tries to avoid solutions
that become too computationally complex. So far it has managed to find a solution to even the most sophisticated
game states that I could devise.

The main algorith lives in [Solver.java](https://github.com/lucasbrambrink/rummykub/blob/main/rummykub/Solver.java)
